## Introduction

LINQ is a powerful feature in C# that allows you to write expressive and efficient queries against collections of data. This task aims to improve your LINQ skills by working on various query scenarios.

## Prerequisites

To complete this task, you will need:

- Visual Studio or an IDE of your choice that supports C# development.
- Basic knowledge of C# and LINQ.

## Task Description

The task involves working with a collection of data, such as a list of objects, and performing various LINQ queries on this data. The goal is to practice different types of LINQ queries, including:

- Filtering: Selecting specific elements from the collection based on certain conditions.
- Ordering: Sorting the elements in the collection in ascending or descending order.
- Grouping: Grouping elements based on common properties.
- Projection: Transforming the data to select specific properties or create new objects.

## Types of LINQ Queries

Here are some examples of the types of LINQ queries you will work on in this task:

1. **Filtering**: Select all products with a price greater than $50.

2. **Ordering**: Sort the list of employees by their salary in descending order.

3. **Grouping**: Group products by category and count the number of products in each category.

4. **Projection**: Create a new list of objects containing only the names and ages of students.

5. **Combining**: Combine filtering, ordering, and projection to select the top 5 highest-paid employees.

6. **Aggregation**: Calculate the average age of students.

7. **Joining**: Join two collections (e.g., orders and customers) based on a common property.

## Running the Task

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the solution in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).

3. Navigate to the LINQ queries file (e.g., `LINQQueries.cs`) and complete the LINQ queries based on the provided scenarios.

4. Run the program to see the results of your LINQ queries.
